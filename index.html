          <h2><i>About the Developer</i></h2>
          <p><center>My name is Taylor Washington (she/her), and I’m a Bay Area–based social worker turned emerging software engineer. I received my BA in Women & Gender Studies from San Francisco State University and my Master of Social Work (MSW) from UC Berkeley, where I focused on Strengthening Organizations and Communities.

My “why” is rooted in compassion, curiosity, and visibility—as a first-generation college graduate and woman of color, I care deeply about representation and designing solutions that create meaningful social change.

For the past 10 years, I’ve worked across the social work field with youth, families, survivors, communities, and organizations. From navigating distance learning during COVID-19, to supporting survivors of sex trafficking in juvenile hall, to lobbying for graduate student policy in Washington, DC, these experiences shaped the way I understand people, systems, and the barriers that exist within them. They’ve also taught me how to lead with empathy, think creatively, and solve problems with both structure and heart.

Today, I’m transitioning into the tech industry as a developing software engineer with a growing interest in tech policy, advocacy, and ethical design. I’m passionate about building projects that bring more joy into the world and designing tools that address the complex social problems of today—and the future. With the world moving deeper into the digital age, I aim to be part of the research, product development, and innovation that brings people more access, representation, and possibility.

I’m currently expanding my skills in software engineering, collaborating on community-centered projects, and exploring how tech can be used as a vehicle for equity, creativity, and impact. Currently, I’m developing projects using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—starting with a recipe page I built from scratch to practice layout and styling. As a participant in Techtonica’s Software Engineering Program, I’m taking on beginner-friendly projects that strengthen my foundational skills and support my goal of breaking into the tech industry.</center></p>
