    <h1><center>Taylor Rae Washington</center></h1>
       <p><center>Hello my name is Taylor Washington (she/her) and I’m from San Mateo, CA. Before being accepted into Techtonica, I was working in the Social Work field for 10 years.
          I haven’t been able to break into tech due to not knowing where to start the process of switching career fields.
            I would make a great Software Engineer because my experience from my past career will help bring a deep understanding of people, systems, problem-solving  and critical thinking. 
              I’m interested in designing projects that give our world the permission to have more fun as well as designing solutions to solve the social problems of today and of the future</center></p>
